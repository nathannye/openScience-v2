          <p>
            Distributed computing has paved the way for patent-free drug
            discovery over the past three decades. By utilizing a network of
            unused home computers, protein folding simulations can be completed
            with incredible speed and help develop life-saving drugs for
            diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer at much lower costs.

          <h3>what is protein folding?</h3>
          <h1>
            Proteins are the basis for cellular function. But to do their work,
            they must
            <em>assemble themselves into a specific shape, or ‘fold’.</em>
          </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Proteins are tiny chains of molecules that, at a micro level, perform
          every function in the body. Each protein has a specific function when
          folded. The problem being: we don’t know why they fold in specific
          ways, making it nearly impossible to tell what a specific protein
          does, or how it does it.

              Terminal diseases, like Alzheimer’s, cancer, and cystic fibrosis
              are believed to be caused by protein misfolds.

            <h3>why does folding matter?</h3>
            <p>
              When we discover how, and why proteins fold into specific
              structures, we can understand what makes things go wrong. Helping
              us develop therapies for previously incurable diseases.

              Through a network of home computers, scientists can boost their
              folding speeds by hundreds of times.
