              Proteins are the basis for cellular function. But to do their
              work, they must assemble themselves into a specific shape, or
              ‘fold’.
            </h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Proteins are tiny chains of molecules that, at a micro level,
            perform every function in the body. Each protein has a specific
            function when folded. The problem being: we don’t know why they fold
            in specific ways, making it nearly impossible to tell what a
            specific protein does, or how it does it.
